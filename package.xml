  <summary>Database Abstraction Layer</summary>
  <description>
DB is a database abstraction layer providing:
* an OO-style query API
* a DSN (data source name) format for specifying
  database servers
* prepare/execute (bind) emulation for databases
  that don't support it natively
* a result object for each query response
* portable error codes
* sequence emulation
* sequential and non-sequential row fetching as well
  as bulk fetching
* ordered array, associative array and object formats
  supported for the fetched rows
* row limit support
* transactions support
* table information interface
* DocBook and PHPDoc API documentation

DB layers itself on top of PHP's existing database
extensions.  The currently supported extensions are:
dbase, fbsql, interbase, informix, msql, mssql, mysql,
oci8, odbc, pgsql, sqlite and sybase (DB style
interfaces to LDAP servers and MS ADO (using COM) are
also avaible from a separate package).

    <notes>
== GENERAL NOTES ============
- PEAR DB now requires PHP to be at version 4.2.0 or greater.
- An **experimental** driver for mysql4 has been added.  (nicos, Roman, et al)
- The version numbers has been increased to 1.6.0 due to major changes, thereby skipping over a final 1.5.0 release.
- All changes by danielc unless otherwise noted.

== DB.php & common.php ======
- Make the $options argument in connect() default to an array to improve documentation.
- Add strtolower() to all get_class() calls, creating PHP 4/5 compatibility.
- Speed up connect() a bit by doing one is_array() up front.
- factory() now has $options parameter and the error reporting / setOption() code related thereto.  Bug 25.
- Have DB_result::tableInfo() -- which has been long deprecated -- forward a result object rather than a result resource.
- Removed deprecated constants DB_WARNING and DB_WARNING_READ_ONLY
- Add DB_FETCHMODE_OBJECT support to fetchAssoc().  Bug 232.  **ONLY WORKS IN PHP 4.**
- var $phptype was misnamed $type.
- Save a couple steps in constructor by setting values in var declarations.
- Allow '.' in sequence names.  Bug 135.
- Speed getRow() a tad more by making default $params an array.
- getRow() drop general checks/settype by more efficient specific checks earlier.  Fix docblock param order.
- trim() $nativecode because some error strings have line breaks at end.
- Fix broken fold marks.  (ssb)
- Add 'ssl' connection option to $options/setOption().
- Fix ; to : at end of case statement.  Bug 617.
- REFINE PREPARE/EXECUTE EMULATION
    * Allow scalars in addition to arrays.
    * prepare() now allows placeholder characters to be escaped so they can be used in literals.  Bug 31.
    * Allow associative arrays to be passed to execute() and (perhaps speed things) up by using foreach instead of for.  Bug 585.
    * Fix wrong splitting by \ in prepare().  Bug 45.  (cox)
    * Use fopen($file, 'rb') to make sure we get binary data properly on Windows platforms. (chagenbu)
    * Eliminate unnecessary variable assignments.
    * Move error checking up front so it doesn't need to be repeated in for loop.
    * Reorganize conditional statements to reduce need for executing them.
    * Raise DB_ERROR_ACCESS_VIOLATION on fopen() failure.
    * Use fread() instead of while fgets().
    * Adjust docblocks to match changes and related realities.

== All Drivers ==============
- Whitespace cleanup.
- Docblock enhancements.
- Change double quotes to single quotes for minor efficiency gain on strings that don't need to be evaluated.
- quoteSmart() and escapeSimple() methods introduced.
- quote() and quoteString() are now officially deprecated.
- REWORK PORTABILITY FEATURES
    * Added new 'portability' option.
    * The 'optimize' option is now deprecated, but full backwards compatibility is built in.
    * Each portability feature can be turned on and off.
    * New portability feature allows right trimming database output.
    * All DBMS's can now lowercase field names.  Bug 397.
    * All tableInfo() methods now have the ability to lowercase table and field names.
    * Portability features enabled/disabled by passing bitwised constants to DB_common::setOption().
    * Enhanced docblocks for related methods.
    * Adjusted tests accordingly.
    * This system is documented in the DB_common::setOption() method.
- Dropped freeResult() as a way for freeing prepared queries (cox):
    $res = $dbh->prepare(..);
    $dbh->freeResult($res);
    (that was never documented/used anyways)
    Use $dbh->freePrepared($res) instead

== fbsql ====================
- Fix mem leaks in some drivers even when free() is called.  (cox)
- TABLEINFO() CLEAN UP / STANDARDIZATION
    * Can now be passsed a DB_result object, which has become the primary means of calling this method.
    * Change empty($mode) to is_null($mode) which has lower overhead.
    * Create $got_string variable so don't need to call is_string() over and over.
    * Centralize $result validation check.

== ibase ====================
- Fix mem leaks in some drivers even when free() is called.  (cox)
- TABLEINFO() CLEAN UP / STANDARDIZATION
    * Can now be passsed a DB_result object, which has become the primary means of calling this method.
    * Suppress output from ibase_query() via @.
    * Create limit via 'WHERE 1=0' in the query used when table names submitted.

    * prepare() now allows placeholder characters to be escaped so they can be used in literals.  Bug 31.
    * Allow associative arrays to be passed to execute() and (perhaps speed things) up by using foreach instead of for.  Bug 585.
    * Allow ! as placeholder in prepare().  Bug 91.
    * Fix execute() always requiring placeholders.
    * Use fopen($file, 'rb') to make sure we get binary data properly on Windows platforms.
    * Raise DB_ERROR_ACCESS_VIOLATION on fopen() failure.
    * Do type checking before entering loop to save processing.
    * Speed up by using fread(filesize()) in prepare() instead of doing fread() in loop.
    * Document ability to accept both arrays and scalars.

== ifx ======================
- Fix capitalization of ifxRaiseError().  Thanks peterwb.
- Add return for 'tables' in getSpecialQuery() to make getListOf('tables') work.  From peterwb.
- Fix mem leaks in some drivers even when free() is called.  (cox)

== msql =====================
- Fix mem leaks in some drivers even when free() is called.  (cox)

== mssql ====================
- Add @ to mssql_query() in tableInfo().
- Made possible to call _mssql_field_flags() multiple times with different table names
- Add 8134, 'Divide by zero error encountered' to errormap.  But doesn't pass errormap tests due PHP not reporting it as an error.  See PHP bug 26799.
- Fix mem leaks in some drivers even when free() is called.  (cox)
- TABLEINFO() CLEAN UP / STANDARDIZATION
    * Can now be passsed a DB_result object, which has become the primary means of calling this method.
    * Flags now space-delimited rather than comma-delimited.
    * _mssql_field_flags() revamped (contributed by Joern Barthel <j_barthel@web.de>)
    * _mssql_field_flags() was complaining about invalid indexes for $val.  The keys returned are lower case but the keys used in the script were upper.  Added array_change_key_case() call and changed case of keys in the script.
    * Multi-column indexes now convey 'multiple_key' on more than just the first column.
    * Create limit via 'WHERE 1=0' in the query used when table names submitted.
    * Change empty($mode) to is_null($mode) which has lower overhead.
    * Create $got_string variable so don't need to call is_string() over and over.
    * Centralize $result validation check.
- FIX ERROR HANDLING
    * errorCode() mistakenly returned an mssql error code rather than a PEAR DB code.  Fixed.
    * Added errorNative() method which returns an mssql error code.
    * Have mssqlRaiseError() take advantage of the new/fixed methods.

== mysql ====================
- Fix mem leaks in some drivers even when free() is called.  (cox)
- TABLEINFO() CLEAN UP / STANDARDIZATION
    * Can now be passsed a DB_result object, which has become the primary means of calling this method.
    * Change empty($mode) to is_null($mode) which has lower overhead.
    * Create $got_string variable so don't need to call is_string() over and over.
    * Centralize $result validation check.

== oci8 =====================
- Make modifyLimitQuery() work by properly incrementing $from.  Bug 474.
- Remove ocifreestatement() from freeResult() so can get results from SELECT queries.  Bug 229.  PHP Bug 25747.
- Add errorcode_map for ORA-00921 'unexpected end of SQL command.'  oci8 now passes all errormap tests.
- Suppress stdout by placing @ in front of several OCI*() calls.  Bug 77.
- Return by reference oci8RaiseError().
- Fix mem leaks in some drivers even when free() is called.  (cox)
- TABLEINFO() CLEAN UP / STANDARDIZATION
    * Can now be passsed a DB_result object, which has become the primary means of calling this method.
    * When analyzing a query result, looking up the table name via USER_TAB_COLUMNS fails when more than one table in the schema uses the column name in question.  Drop this 'feature.'
    * Fix bug introduced in August that passed OCIColumnName() to 'type'.
    * 'type' is different for each DBMS, so no need to lowercase it.
    * Change $count to $i for standardization.
    * Suppress output from oci*() calls via @.
    * Check for 'portability' once per column.
    * Reformat $q_fields query to make it more readable and not call unneeded fields.
    * Place $q_fields in $this->last_query to clarify debuging.
    * Change empty($mode) to is_null($mode) which has lower overhead.
    * Create $got_string variable so don't need to call is_string() over and over.
- REFINE PREPARE/EXECUTE

    * Allow ! as placeholder in prepare().  Bug 91.
    * Use fopen($file, 'rb') to make sure we get binary data properly on Windows platforms.
    * Fix OCI8 Execute always requires placeholders.  Bug 72.  (cox)
    * Fix OCI8 Prepare() does not raise SQL parse error.  Bug 73.  (cox)
    * Raise DB_ERROR_ACCESS_VIOLATION on fopen() failure.
    * Speed up by using fread(filesize()) in prepare() instead of doing fread() in loop.
    * Document ability to accept both arrays and scalars.
    * Do type checking before entering loop to save processing.

== odbc =====================
- Fix mem leaks in some drivers even when free() is called.  (cox)

== pgsql ====================
- In tableInfo() flag's default value component: 1) run values through rawurlencode() because spaces would interfere with space separation of the flags list and 2) remove ::datatype from the end since it's already stated in 'type'.
- Allow EXPLAIN in simpleQuery() and merge the method's three preg tests into one.  Bug 593.
- Eliminate potential for undefined variable in _pgFieldFlags().
- Add several items to errorcode_map. pgsql now passes all errormap tests.
- Make error-matching regular expressions case-insensitive. (chagenbu)
- Allow for postgres sockets in a non-standard location.  Bug 339.  (chagenbu)
- Fix mem leaks in some drivers even when free() is called.  (cox)
- Free result fixes.  Bug 25550.  (cox)
- TABLEINFO() CLEAN UP / STANDARDIZATION
    * Can now be passsed a DB_result object, which has become the primary means of calling this method.
    * Change flags from <term> to <term>_key (eg 'unique' is now 'unique_key').
    * If a key is primary, just say 'primary_key', not that and 'unique_key'.
    * Suppress output from pg_exec() via @.
    * Change empty($mode) to is_null($mode) which has lower overhead.
    * Create $got_string variable so don't need to call is_string() over and over.
    * Centralize $result validation check.

== sqlite ===================
- Remove fetchRow().  It's already in DB_result, no other driver has one, argument order was different, works fine without it.
- Catch touch() and chmod() errors.  Bug 292.
- Since only SQLite uses 'mode', remove it from $params in DB.php and add an isset check in sqlite.php.
- Fix connection types. Was using persistent when asked for regular and regular when asked for persistent.  Bug 25806.  (tuupola)
- Remove unused DB_FETCHMODE_BOTH constanst.  (tuupola)
- Add debug information from sqlite_last_error() in sqliteRaiseError().  (tuupola)
- Fix mem leaks in some drivers even when free() is called.  (cox)

== storage ==================
- Add strtolower() to all get_class() calls, creating PHP 4/5 compatibililty.
- PEAR.php already required in DB.php
- Return by reference fixes.  Bug 361.
- Some cleanup (mj):
    * Using <br /> instead of <br>
    * Removing usage of @ and replacing that with a more elaborate construct.
    * Removing usage of non-existing member variable $_discard.

== sybase ===================
- Allow empty passwords.  Bug 564.
- Add tableInfo().
- Implement sequences.
- Make fetchInto() drop numbered keys when DB_FETCHMODE_ASSOC.  Bug 350.
- Quiet the sybase connect call.  Bug 437.
- Set $this->_db so sybase_select_db() in simpleQuery() will work.  Bug 49.
- Fix mem leaks in some drivers even when free() is called.  (cox)
- MAKE ERROR MESSAGES WORK:
    * Use foreach() in errorCode() so loop starts at begining of $error_regexps array each time.
    * Add some new error string expressions to $error_regexps.
    * Change values of $error_regexps from Sybase error codes to DB constants.
    * Delete all elements in $errorcode_map because Sybase extension doesn't return error codes.
    * Simplify errorCode() and sybaseRaiseError().  Was passing inappropriate arguments to raiseError() -- Sybase's native message went $userinfo and needlessly tried sending DB's own message to $native.  Now native goes to $native and $userinfo is null.
    * Add docblocks for these error methods.
    * Divide by zero error doesn't pass errormap tests due PHP not reporting it as an error.

== tests ====================
- Expanded range of tests.
- Adjusted tests to ensure they work under both PHP 4 and PHP 5.
- Each test creates and drops all needed tables, even when tests fail.
